# cube-world
A game myself and [@peterhall16](https://github.com/peterhall16) made years ago.

## Introduction
I made this project as high school freshman (2014-2015 ish) as began to get
interested in programming. This is probably the first "complete" project I ever made.

I've left this directory in the format that I found it. Until recently, the
source code was believed to be lost.

## Notes
- `css/` - so many CSS files
- `dev photos/` - many unlabeled screenshots of the dev process
- `font/` - fonts, of course
- `images/` - favicons and logos
- `js/` - all the source code
  - `canvas.js` - the main game code. Apparently I didn't know how to use for loops.
  - `records.js` - localstorage-backed high scores engine.
- `pages/` - a lot of these don't work; I shall not fix them.
  - `best.html` - high scores
  - `hame-backup.html` - I have literally no idea
  - `home.html` - game menu
  - `info.html` - credits page
  - `more.html` - a blank page?
  - `rankings.html` - looks like we never finished this part
  - `upgrade.html` - we had the idea of making this into a Win8 app when those
    were a thing.
- `rounded_square/` and `Social Media Icons/` - visual dependecies
